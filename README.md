All pages except the login page and the signup page have protected routes 
and require users to be logged in in order to be accessed.

## Integrating with React App

The react app was integrated thourgh proxying on port 8080 to the api. 
The react app used the api to gather the information needed to diplay 
movies and information whilst the api stored the created users and 
their favourites.

~~~Javascript from /api/topRated

import express from 'express';

import topRatedModel from './topRatedModel';

const router = express.Router();

// eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars
router.get('/', (req, res,next) => {
    topRatedModel.find().then(topRated => res.status(200).send(topRated)).catch(next);
  });
